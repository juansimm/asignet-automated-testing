- Seed file: `playwright/tests/seed.spec.ts`
- Agents: planner -> generator -> healer

## Scenario Input

# Scenario Context (No DBO)

## Objective
search in https://playwright.dev/docs/test-agents#agent-definitions if this text/senetence exists: "Start with adding Playwright Test Agent definitions to your project"

## Product Context
Describe app area, user role, and preconditions.

## Constraints
List technical/business rules, forbidden actions, and stable locator expectations.

## Required Assertions
List required checks after each critical step and final business outcome.

## Agent Instructions
- Translate this into deterministic Playwright steps.
- Prefer role/label/test-id selectors.
- Add explicit assertions after critical actions.
- Keep test names behavior-focused.

## Required Output

1. Planner: create a comprehensive test plan markdown file under `specs/`.
2. Generator: produce executable Playwright tests under `playwright/tests/`.
3. Healer: run tests, debug failures, and fix flaky/broken tests until green.

## Constraints

- Use explicit assertions for every critical user step.
- Keep test names behavior-focused and deterministic.
- Prefer stable locators (role, label, test id) over brittle CSS selectors.
