**Generated:** 2026-02-19  
**Source:** request_20260219_125338.md  
**Test File:** playwright/tests/seed.spec.ts

## Objective

Verify that the text "Start with adding Playwright Test Agent definitions to your project" exists on the Playwright documentation page at https://playwright.dev/docs/test-agents#agent-definitions.

---

## Test Scenario

### Scenario 1: Verify Text Existence on Documentation Page

**Description:**  
Navigate to the Playwright test-agents documentation page and verify that the specific sentence "Start with adding Playwright Test Agent definitions to your project" exists in the page content.

**Preconditions:**
- Browser is launched and page is available
- No prior navigation has occurred

**Test Steps:**

1. **Navigate to the target URL**
   - Step: Navigate to `https://playwright.dev/docs/test-agents#agent-definitions`
   - Expected: Page loads successfully without errors
   - Assertion: Verify page URL contains `playwright.dev/docs/test-agents`

2. **Wait for page content to load**
   - Step: Wait for the page to fully load
   - Expected: Page DOM is ready
   - Assertion: Verify page title is visible or contains "Playwright"

3. **Locate the target text on the page**
   - Step: Search for the text "Start with adding Playwright Test Agent definitions to your project"
   - Expected: The text should be present in the page content
   - Assertion 1: Verify the text exists in the page body using text search
   - Assertion 2: Verify the text is visible (not hidden or obscured)

4. **Verify text context (optional)**
   - Step: If text is found, verify it's within the correct section (near `#agent-definitions` anchor)
   - Expected: Text appears in the agent definitions section
   - Assertion: Verify the heading "Agent definitions" or related content is present

---

## Success Criteria

| Step | Criteria | Pass Condition |
|------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Page navigation | URL matches expected path |
| 2 | Page loaded | Page title visible |
| 3 | Text found | Text string exists in DOM |
| 3 | Text visible | Element is visible to user |

---

## Failure Conditions

- Page fails to load or returns 404
- Target text does not exist on the page
- Text exists but is hidden/invisible
- Page navigation times out

---

## Locator Strategy

- Primary: Use page text content search (getByText or locator with text)
- Fallback: Use URL-based verification and page content extraction
- Avoid: Brittle CSS selectors; prefer semantic text-based locators

---

## Notes

- This is a simple presence verification test
- No form interactions required
- No authentication needed
- Test should be deterministic and repeatable
