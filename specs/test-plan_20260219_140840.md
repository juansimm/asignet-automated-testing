# Test Plan: Playwright Test Agents Documentation Verification

- **Created at**: 2026-02-19T14:08:40.000Z
- **Seed file**: `playwright/tests/seed.spec.ts`
- **Objective**: Verify existence of specific text in Playwright documentation

---

## Scenario 1: Verify Text Exists in Test Agents Documentation

### Objective
Navigate to the Playwright test agents documentation page and verify that the sentence "Start with adding Playwright Test Agent definitions to your project" exists on the page.

### Test Scope
- **Target URL**: https://playwright.dev/docs/test-agents#agent-definitions
- **Verification**: Text presence assertion

### Preconditions
- Browser is available and initialized
- No prior navigation to the target page

### Test Steps

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Navigate to `https://playwright.dev/docs/test-agents#agent-definitions` | Page loads successfully, URL matches target |
| 2 | Wait for page content to be fully loaded | Page is ready for interaction |
| 3 | Search for text "Start with adding Playwright Test Agent definitions to your project" | Text is found on the page |

### Assertions

| Assertion | Description | Failure Condition |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Page loads successfully | HTTP status 200 or equivalent | Page fails to load or returns error |
| URL matches target | `https://playwright.dev/docs/test-agents#agent-definitions` | Navigation to wrong URL |
| Text exists on page | Text "Start with adding Playwright Test Agent definitions to your project" is present in the DOM | Text not found on page |

### Success Criteria
- Page navigates to the correct URL
- The target text is visible on the page

### Edge Cases
- Page loads but content is still rendering (use wait for load state)
- Text exists but is hidden (ensure visibility)
- Page redirects to a different location

---

## Scenario 2: Verify Anchor Link Functionality

### Objective
Confirm that the `#agent-definitions` anchor link correctly scrolls to the relevant section.

### Test Steps

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Navigate to `https://playwright.dev/docs/test-agents` (base page without anchor) | Base page loads |
| 2 | Click or navigate to `#agent-definitions` anchor | URL updates to include anchor |
| 3 | Verify the agent definitions section is visible | Section is in viewport |

### Assertions

| Assertion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Anchor navigation works | URL contains `#agent-definitions` after navigation |
| Section is visible | Agent definitions content is rendered and visible |

---

## Test Configuration

### Browser Settings
- **Viewport**: 1280x720 (desktop)
- **Navigation timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Action timeout**: 5 seconds

### Locator Strategy
- Use `getByText()` for text content verification
- Use `page.url()` for URL verification
- Use visibility checks for element presence

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Test navigates to `https://playwright.dev/docs/test-agents#agent-definitions`
2. ✅ Page loads without errors
3. ✅ Text "Start with adding Playwright Test Agent definitions to your project" is found on the page
4. ✅ Test passes with explicit assertions for each critical step
